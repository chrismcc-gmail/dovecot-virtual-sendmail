### The Hack to make virtual users work with sendmail

TLDR:

abuse glibc's nss_db in /var/db with a makefile target something like:

$(VAR_DB)/passwd.db: /etc/dovecot/usersfile
	@printf %s "$(patsubst %.db,%,$(@F))... "
	@$(AWK) 'BEGIN { FS=":"; OFS=":" } \
		 /^[ \t]*$$/ { next } \
		 /^[ \t]*#/ { next } \
		 /^root/ { next } \
		 /^[^#]/ { printf ".%s ", $$1; \
		printf "%s:x:65534:65534:%s:/home/vmail/%s:/sbin/nologin\n", $$1, $$1, $$1; \
			                             }' $^ | \
	$(MAKEDB) -o $@ -
	@echo "done."

### Longer version
I needed email for a new domain name for a new project.  For this project I
also needed to run a public authoritative name server, might as well use the
same server for email also.  The default sendmail and dovecot packages in
CentOS mostly just work out of the box. But as a sysadmin, I wanted to make it
better.  Reading up on dovecot, I saw that it could use virtual users rather
than system users.  Great!  Then I realized that sendmail will not see them.
After some web searching and pondering for an afternoon, I remembered a nsswitch
option that most people don't use, db files for fast lookup.  By default it adds
the contents of /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, /etc/group, and some lesser used files
to a key lookup (?) style database.  This allows the system to do fast uid/gid
lookups when there are thousands of local users.  There is a Makefile in /var/db
that generates the /var/db/passwd.db, /var/db/group.db files. I added /etc/dovecot/usersfile to the passwd line, ran make, and boom, 'getent passwd' showed the
dovecot users also.  

After some more testing, the result was a /var/db/Makefile with only one target
/var/db/passwd.db that only used /etc/dovecot/usersfile.  And
 "passwd:      files db  systemd" in /etc/nsswitch.conf.  Having files before db
should allow a shell user to also have the same username in dovecot, but I 
wouldn't recommend it.  I tested it with no problems, but there could be a
corner case hidden somewhere.  Also the crypt passwd field from dovecot's
virtual users is not used, nor is /var/db/shadow created, the system will never
authenticate them.

I consider it a hack that works

[root@centos8 ~]# touch /etc/dovecot/usersfile 
[root@centos8 ~]# cat /etc/dovecot/usersfile 
# root needs to be here to get mail from the aliases in /etc/aliases
# the Makefile skips it
# generate passwds with doveadm, doveadm pw -p test
# then update system with:
# make -C /var/db
# getent passwd to verify
#
root:{CRYPT}nopasswd:::::
admin:{CRYPT}createwithdoveadm:::::
virtualuser:{CRYPT}createwithdoveadm:::::
othervuser:{CRYPT}createwithdoveadm:::::
[root@centos8 ~]# make -C /var/db 
make: Entering directory '/var/db'
passwd... done.
make: Leaving directory '/var/db'
